<div id="work" class="workexp">
  <div class="exp-row">
<h3>Procurement Specialist, Rus-Motors (Atyrau, Kazakhstan) 2020-2022</h3>
<p> I was the first person on this position in the company and my main big task wast to
  establish an efficient supply chain that would allow company to purchase goods from abroad in 
  short peridods of time for a good price.
<br>
  I started my work form sourcing: finding suppliers, evaluating them and negotiating contract terms.
As soon as our companies came to an agreement we started the work.
<br>
First order was relatively small but it was also the toughest one since I had to learn by doing. I have made some mistakes 
but I also figured out how to avoid these mistakes in the future. 
<br>
Later, I came up with an idea how to shorten customs procedures time by 1-2 weeks and quite soon 
the whole supply chain was running like clockwork.
